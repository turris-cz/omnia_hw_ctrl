 * IMPORTANT:
 *   The interrupt related commands (CMD_GET_INT_AND_CLEAR, CMD_GET_INT_MASK and
 *   CMD_SET_INT_MASK) return/expect 8 bytes of data: 32 bits for rising edge
 *   and 32 bits for falling edge.
 *   The important thing is that this 8 bytes ARE ENCODED IN INTERLEAVED ORDER:
 *
 *     r[0], f[0], r[1], f[1], r[2], f[2], r[3], f[3]
 *
 *   instead of the expected order
 *
 *     r[0..4], f[0..4]
 *
 *   (where x[0] contain bits 0..7, x[1] bits 8..15, etc., and r contains rising
 *    edge set/mask, f contain falling edge set/mask).
 *
 *   This interleaved order is used to allow for more efficient interrupt status
 *   reading: when the application is interested in only the first 6 interrupts,
 *   it is possible to read just the first two bytes of the reply of
 *   CMD_GET_INT_AND_CLEAR, and stop the I2C transaction after those 2 bytes.
 *   The two bytes contain rising and falling edge states of interrupts 0..7.
 *
 *   Reading only first 2 bytes of the reply instead of all 8 bytes saves time /
 *   makes the interrupt handler faster, since I2C bus is slow.
 *
 *   It is possible to write simple macros to get the bit position for a
 *   rising / falling interrupt flag in the interleaved order:
 *
 *       #define RISING_BITNR(n)  ((2 * ((n) / 8)) * 8 + ((n) % 8))
 *       #define FALLING_BITNR(n) (RISING_BITNR(n) + 8)
 *       #define __bf_shf(x)      (__builtin_ffsll(x) - 1)
 *       #define RISING_BIT(f)    BIT(RISING_BITNR(__bf_shf((f))))
 *       #define FALLING_BIT(f)    BIT(FALLING_BITNR(__bf_shf((f))))
 *
 *       enum int_interleaved_e {
 *           INT_CARD_DET_RISING    = RISING_BIT(INT_CARD_DET),
 *           INT_CARD_DET_FALLING   = FALLING_BIT(INT_CARD_DET),
 *           INT_MSATA_IND_RISING   = RISING_BIT(INT_INT_MSATA_IND),
 *           INT_MSATA_IND_FALLING  = FALLING_BIT(INT_INT_MSATA_IND),
 *           ...
 *       };

=== CMD_GET_INT_MASK
* Get the interrupt mask.
* Available only if NEW_INT_API bit is set in features.
* Read only

* Available only if NEW_INT_API bit is set in features.
* Write only
