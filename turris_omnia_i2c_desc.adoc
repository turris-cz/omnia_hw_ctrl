 *         On v32+ boards it corresponds also to the nLED_WWAN and nLED_WPAN
 *         pins.
 * note 2: On pre-v32 boards, WLAN*_LED corresponds to the nLED_WLAN pin of the
 *         MiniPCIe port.
 *         On v32+ boards it corresponds (as logical OR) to nLED_WWAN, nLED_WLAN
 *         and nLED_WPAN pins.
 * note 3: On pre-v32 boards, WPAN*_LED bits correspond to the nLED_WPAN pins of
 *         the MiniPCIe port.
 *         On v32+ boards, WPAN*_LED bits are unavailable, because their
 *         functionality is ORed in WLAN*_LED bits.
 * note 4: WAN_LED1 is only available on v32+ boards.

* Example of a reading of the extended status dword from Linux:
** "i2ctransfer 1 w1@0x2a 0x11 r4"

* Example of a setting of the control byte (do a light reset):
** "i2cset 1 0x2A 2 0x0101 w"
*** 1 -> i2cbus number
*** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
*** 2 -> "address of the register" = command

*** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
*** 0x12 -> "address of the register" = command
*** 0x00 0x00 -> value of the word, lower byte first. Bit 3 is 0 -> release PERST0 from reset
*** 0x08 0x00 -> value of the mask, lower byte first. Bit 3 is 1 -> bit 3 will be changed
***	i -> block data type

=== CMD_GET_EXT_CONTROL_STATUS
* Reads status of extended control.
* Available only if the EXT_CMDS bit is set in features.
* Read only
* Bit meaning same as for extended control dword.

* Example of an extended control reading
** "i2cget 1 0x2A 0x13 w"
*** 1 -> i2cbus number
*** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
*** 0x13 -> "address of the register" = command
***	w -> word data type


=== CMD_GET_INT_AND_CLEAR
* Get and clear interrupt status.
* Available only if NEW_INT_API bit is set in features.
* Read only
* Returns 8 bytes of data, but it is possible to read fewer, if the application
  is only interested in the interrupt flags that are in the beginning of the
  result.

[source,C]
/*
 * Bit meanings in interrupt status and interrupt mask:
 *  Bit Nr. |   Meanings                |   Corresponds to
 * ---------|---------------------------|--------------------
 *      0   |   INT_CARD_DET            |   STS_CARD_DET
 *      1   |   INT_MSATA_IND           |   STS_MSATA_IND
 *      2   |   INT_USB30_OVC           |   STS_USB30_OVC
 *      3   |   INT_USB31_OVC           |   STS_USB31_OVC
 *      4   |   INT_BUTTON_PRESSED      |   STS_BUTTON_PRESSED
 *      5   |   INT_SFP_NDET            |   EXT_STS_SFP_NDET
 *  6..11   |   reserved
 * 12..31   |   LED states interrupts   |   EXT_STS_*_LED*
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 *   The interrupt related commands (CMD_GET_INT_AND_CLEAR, CMD_GET_INT_MASK and
 *   CMD_SET_INT_MASK) return/expect 8 bytes of data: 32 bits for rising edge
 *   and 32 bits for falling edge.
 *   The important thing is that this 8 bytes ARE ENCODED IN INTERLEAVED ORDER:
 *
 *     r[0], f[0], r[1], f[1], r[2], f[2], r[3], f[3]
 *
 *   instead of the expected order
 *
 *     r[0..4], f[0..4]
 *
 *   (where x[0] contain bits 0..7, x[1] bits 8..15, etc., and r contains rising
 *    edge set/mask, f contain falling edge set/mask).
 *
 *   This interleaved order is used to allow for more efficient interrupt status
 *   reading: when the application is interested in only the first 6 interrupts,
 *   it is possible to read just the first two bytes of the reply of
 *   CMD_GET_INT_AND_CLEAR, and stop the I2C transaction after those 2 bytes.
 *   The two bytes contain rising and falling edge states of interrupts 0..7.
 *
 *   Reading only first 2 bytes of the reply instead of all 8 bytes saves time /
 *   makes the interrupt handler faster, since I2C bus is slow.
 *
 *   It is possible to write simple macros to get the bit position for a
 *   rising / falling interrupt flag in the interleaved order:
 *
 *       #define RISING_BITNR(n)  ((2 * ((n) / 8)) * 8 + ((n) % 8))
 *       #define FALLING_BITNR(n) (RISING_BITNR(n) + 8)
 *       #define __bf_shf(x)      (__builtin_ffsll(x) - 1)
 *       #define RISING_BIT(f)    BIT(RISING_BITNR(__bf_shf((f))))
 *       #define FALLING_BIT(f)    BIT(FALLING_BITNR(__bf_shf((f))))
 *
 *       enum int_interleaved_e {
 *           INT_CARD_DET_RISING    = RISING_BIT(INT_CARD_DET),
 *           INT_CARD_DET_FALLING   = FALLING_BIT(INT_CARD_DET),
 *           INT_MSATA_IND_RISING   = RISING_BIT(INT_INT_MSATA_IND),
 *           INT_MSATA_IND_FALLING  = FALLING_BIT(INT_INT_MSATA_IND),
 *           ...
 *       };
 */


=== CMD_GET_INT_MASK
* Get the interrupt mask.
* Available only if NEW_INT_API bit is set in features.
* Read only
* Bit meaning same as for the CMD_GET_INT_AND_CLEAR command, but the bits
  represent which interrupts are enabled.


=== CMD_SET_INT_MASK
* Set the interrupt mask.
* Available only if NEW_INT_API bit is set in features.
* Write only
* Bit meaning same as for the CMD_GET_INT_MASK command.


=== CMD_LED_MODE
* We distinguish between two modes: default (HW) mode or user mode.
* Write only
* Bit overview:

[source,C]
/*
 * Bit meanings in led mode byte:
 *  Bit Nr. |   Meanings
 * -----------------
 *   0..3   |   LED number [0..11] (or in case setting of all LED at once -> LED number = 12)

** "i2cget 1 0x2B 0x31 b"
*** 1 -> i2cbus number
*** 0x2B -> I2C address of the LED controller
*** 0x31 -> command
***	b -> byte data type


=== CMD_USER_VOLTAGE
* There is one dc/dc regulator which is switched off by default
** It can be used as an extra power supply for non-typical miniPCI cards.
* It is possible to set these voltages: 3.3V, 3.6V, 4.5V, 5.1V
* HW modification of the board is needed as well (see electric diagram)
* Default voltage after enabling the regulator is 4.5V
* Write only
* The procedure has two steps
** 1. step - enable the dc/dc regulator
*** "i2cset 1 0x2A 2 0x2020 w"
**** 1 -> i2cbus number
**** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
**** 2 -> "address of the register" = command
**** 0x2020 - enable the regulator
**** w -> word data type

** 2. step - set desired voltage
*** "i2cset 1 0x2A 6 1 b"
**** 1 -> i2cbus number
**** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
**** 6 -> "address of the register" = command
**** 1 - value for 3.3V
***** values for voltages:
1 -> 3.3V;
2 -> 3.6V;
3 -> 4.5V;
4 -> 5.1V;
**** b -> word data type


=== CMD_GET_RESET
* Reports reset type to main CPU
* The system reads this information after each reset
* Read only

* Example of a reading of the reset type
** "i2cget 1 0x2A 9 b"
*** 1 -> i2cbus number
*** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
*** 9 -> "address of the register" = command
***	b -> byte data type


=== CMD_SET_WATCHDOG_STATE
* Either enable/ping (= 1) or disable (= 0)
* After boot watchdog is enabled with default timeout, which is 2 minutes.
* It should either be disabled in less than 2 minutes, or pinged, to restart the counter.

* Example of a writing to the watchdog state
** "i2cset 1 0x2A 0x0B 0 b"
*** 1 -> i2cbus number
*** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
*** 0x0B -> "address of the register" = command
*** 0 -> stop the watchdog
***	b -> byte data type

* Example of a reading of the watchdog state
** "i2cget 1 0x2A 0x0D b"
*** 1 -> i2cbus number
*** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
*** 0x0D -> "address of the register" = command
***	b -> byte data type


=== CMD_SET_WDT_TIMEOUT
* Ping watchdog / set watchdog timeout in 0.1s units
* Available only if WDT_PING feature bit is set in CMD_GET_FEATURES
* Write only

* Example of pinging watchdog and setting 60s timeout
** "i2cset 1 0x2a 0x20 0x258 w"
*** 1 -> i2cbus number
*** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
*** 0x20 -> "address of the register" = command
*** 0x258 -> 60 seconds * 10 = 600 = 0x258
***	w -> word data type


=== CMD_GET_WDT_TIMELEFT
* Get watchdog time left in 0.1s units
* Available only if WDT_PING feature bit is set in CMD_GET_FEATURES
* Read only

* Example of reading watchdog time left
** "i2cget 1 0x2a 0x21 w"
*** 1 -> i2cbus number
*** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
*** 0x21 -> "address of the register" = command
***	w -> word data type


=== CMD_GET_FW_VERSION_APP and CMD_GET_FW_VERSION_BOOT
* reads version of bootloader and application code in MCU
* accessible only with our script


=== CMD_GET_FW_CHECKSUM
* reads application code length and checksum
